# do-it-to-it
Following along with a freeCodeCamp.org tutorial, this is a 'to do' list web app made using Flask.

My intention is to play around with this and make a few other changes to it myself.

Potential changes could include:
 - Setting a timer on when tasks should be achieved by
 - Working out how long is left on tasks, given deadline
 - Outputting task list in printable format
 - Creating a 'login' so multiple users have access
 - Pushing to heroku
